# Introduction
  This project will provide you with a quick look into job availability of data science roles üßë‚Äçüî¨ in USA during COVID-19 (2020) ü¶†, in this finding, I will use SQL for data Cleaning and data exploration tool and use Excel as  visualization tool. at the end of this project, you will be well informed of each state characteristic for data science roles and company size based on each sector.

# Background
The data we will be using, was retrieved form **Kaggle Dataset** , Kaggle is an online platform that serves as a community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners and recognized as one of the top resources for learning, sharing, and competing in data science.
  dataset that i will be looking into is **"Data Science Job Posting on Glassdoor"** And the reason why we used this dataset, was due to the following reason

    1.To find and insight into data science jobs, which field, role, state offer the highest salary
    2.To find sector or industry has the most job availability in data science role in order for job seekers to hone thier skill and knowledge accordingly.
    3.To hone my skill as a data analyst for data cleaning , data exploration , data Analysis  and data visualization.
   
   
The questions that we will be answering:

     1.Which sector has the most job available during COVID-19 (2020)?

     2.Which states has the most online job posting during the start of COVID-19 (2020)?

     3.What are proportion of company size for each sector?

     4.What are trend sector across each state in USA during COVID-19? 

# Limitation
1. Salary inaccuracy:  
The most important data for any job seeker in any field, must be salary data of each job. However, after data was cleaned , explored and prepared for data analysis. I notice that the salary data was inaccurate and cannot be use. 

![salary_groupby_jobtitle](asset/salary_groupby_jobtitle.png) 
  
*table 1 showing average salary group by job_title

![salary_of_datascientist_in_each_state](asset/salary_of_datascientist_in_each_state.png) 

*table 2 showing salary of top 5 data scientist in each state

From table 1 and table 2 you can see:
-Data Scientist had more salary than Senior Data Engineer
-Data Analyst had roughly the same salary and Data Engineer or Data Scientist
-The city that has the most highest cost of living in USA (e.g. California , Massachusetts ,New York,New Jersey )

This is very too counterintuitive and very much deviate from the norm. So, I decided that i will not be using salary data as part of data analysis. the inaccuracy that occured maybe due to the fact that the original data was retrived in salary range, but we cleaned and use it in median salary or it might be due to Glassdoor data error. because Glassdoor was a self-report data website, even if they had some measurement regarding to data inaccuracy, this might not be enough.

2. Online Job Postings:   
Data comes from Glassdoor, which is skewed toward sectors and companies that are more digital and proactive in online job postings (e.g., IT, business services).

3.  Age of Data:  
The data being analyzed is from 4 years ago, specifically from 2020. As such, it may not fully represent current market conditions, trends, or demand for specific job roles in the biotech, data science, or other sectors.

4. Lack of Comparative Data:  
The dataset used in this analysis covers only one year (2020). Without data from subsequent years or earlier periods, it is impossible to assess trends over time. a comparison across multiple years would provide a more comprehensive view of job posting trends.


# Tools  

-SQL: Used for data exploration and cleaning. SQL allowed me to query, filter, and organize the data, ensuring it was structured properly for analysis.

-PostgreSQL: Served as the database management system, where all the data was stored and managed. It enabled efficient data retrieval and storage.

-Excel: Employed for data visualization. Excel was used to create clear and effective charts, graphs, and pivot tables to represent insights from the data.

-Visual Studio Code: Used for executing queries and editing SQL code. Visual Studio Code provided an intuitive environment for working with scripts and running queries efficiently.

-Git and GitHub: Used for version control, ensuring that all changes to the project were tracked. GitHub facilitated collaboration, code sharing, and maintaining a well-organized project history.

# The Analysis
The main focus of this analysis will be job availability across state and also the detail of which sector has the most job posting during COVID-19, and investigate further whether company size has an effect on recruitment during COVID-19 or not

**1. Which sector has the most job available during COVID-19 (2020)?**

 To identify which sector has the most job availability, I use count function and group by sector, this query will focus on Top 5 sector with the most job posting

``` SQL
SELECT sector, COUNT(job_title) 
FROM job_data_staging_2
WHERE sector IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sector
ORDER BY COUNT(job_title)  DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
